# Connect-To.bat
Purpose:
To Create an open source free Remote Desktop automator, so after the first setup, the user only needs to click on this program to connect to a remote computer.
Designed for buisiness with remote workers or IT profesionals.

Designed for Windows computers, and has compatability check so will only run on Windows 7 up (excluding windows 8.0). This can be removed.

Similar purpose to app that i am trying to build here: https://github.com/Samuel12321/Connect-To except this program doesnt have a GUI and uses windows inbuilt tools instead of its own.

Tool to convert to .exe: http://www.f2ko.de/apps/ob2e/
